{"bltaf8a76116ea228ed":{"title":"Ghost Voices","url":"/songs/ghost-voices","description":"\"Ghost Voices\" is a song by American electronic music producer Porter Robinson under the alias Virtual Self. It was released on November 8, 2017 as the second single from the alias' self-titled debut EP, which uses early 2000s sounds and aesthetics. Robinson said that \"Ghost Voices\" was the easiest song from the EP to compose, and he used a house-styled drum pattern and a trance-styled break. In 2018, the song received an official music video and was remixed by Raito and Robinson himself, the latter remix being called \"Angel Voices\". \"Ghost Voices\" received a nomination for Best Dance Recording at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.","lyrics":"[Intro]\nSometimes, some days\nSometimes you say\nSometimes, some days\n\n[Hook]\nCan't you say\nCan't you say\nSometimes you say\nCan't you

prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA\nBackbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge\nSee, my pedigree is a whole 'nother breed\nAnd you's a motherf***in' b****\nI got my finger on the mothaf***in' trigger\nAnd I'ma tell you everything and I'ma say it with a passion\nI grew up in a project, roaches and rats\nDope, needles, and pins, I've been in it since an infant\nLife ain't nothin' but a b**** on the rag, I'm the rags-to-riches\nN----, I'm the one, you can't be like this, n----\nN----, I'm the one, I said I'm the one\nA-1, every day, G-O-D, I am the one\nSo you can't be like this, n----\nI'm a savage, I'm an a**, I'm a king\nI'm a stunt, I'm a god, I'm a n----, a b****\nI'm a f**, I'm a thug, I'm a nerd, I'm a b****\nI'm whatever you say I am\nIf I wasn't, then why would I say I am?\nIn the paper, the news, every day I am\nRadio won't play this, they know I'm not a fa-a-ake\nThat's my DNA, I'm not a fa-a-ake\nDon't you tell me what you think of me\nI'm a god, I'm a king, I'm a giant\nYou's a b****, you a dub, you a puppet\nSee, my DNA is not for imitation\nYour DNA an abomination\nThis how it is when you're in the Matrix\nDodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow\nAnd stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go\nAnd sleepin' in a villa\nSippin' from a Grammy, and walkin' in the buildin'\nDiamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors\nBeach inside the window, peekin' out the window\nBaby in the pool, godfather with the tool\nI don't need a witness, I'ma live in secret\nI'ma die with secrets, my DNA is deep\nAnd I don't give a f*** and I ain't in the streets\nAnd I ain't on the ‘Gram, and I ain't on the beat\nI'm a good man with some bad habits\nI'm a sober man with some bad habits\nI'm a high man with some bad habits\nI'm a proud man with some bad habits\nAnd my DNA is not for imitation\nYour DNA an abomination\nThis how it is when you in the Matrix\nYah!\n\n[Outro: Rick James]\nMary-Anne, ha, ha, ha,
